## About

These four pin connectors are often used simply when you find you have four wires that need connecting. That said a common usage is with data buses, most notably I2C (power (+/gnd) SDA, SCL), or they can also be found on stepper motors when they are being driven in bipolar mode (A+, A-, B+, B-).
