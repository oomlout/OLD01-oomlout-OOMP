## About

These six pin connectors are often used simply when you find you have six wires that need connecting. However they can occasionally be found on a stepper motor being driven in uni-polar mode (A,B,ABCom,C,D,CDCom), or are also handy when paired with a ten pin connector to attach a parallel LCD screen to a project.
