<h1>ID Explained</h1>
</html>
__NOTOC__	
==Summary==
An OOMP ID at first glance can look like a random collection of letters and numbers (ie.<b>RESE-W04-X-O561-01</b>). However it is in fact lovingly crafted to contain enough detail about a part to make it unique, describe it well, and deduce it's name. 

==ID==
Each OOMP ID has 5 parts.

===Type===
This denotes the type of a component. 
(ex.<b>CAPT</b>- Capacitor (Tantalum),<b>RESE</b>- Resistor)
===Size===
This denotes the major size of a component, usually used to define it's physical form factor. 
(ex.<b>I01</b>- 2.54 mm,<b>0603</b>- SMD 0603,<b>W04</b>- 1/4 Watt Resistor)
===Color===
This denotes the color of the component, or if relevant the material it is made from. 
(ex.<b>R</b>- Red,<b>C</b>- Clear,<b>M</b>- Metal,<b>X</b>- None)
===Description===
This denotes either an additional detail about a component 
(ex.<b>FROS</b>- Frosted<b>STAN</b>- Standard)
or the value of the component. 
(ex.<b>220UF</b>- 220 uf,<b>36P</b>- 36 Pole,<b>O561</b>- 560 Ohm)
===Index===
This is used to fine tune a component either if a particular supplier, or a special specification not catered to in the other elements is required. 
(ex.<b>67</b>- +/-1% Precision,<b>0</b>1 - Normal)

<b>ID: TYPE - SIZE - COLOR - DESCRIPTION - INDEX</b>

(ex.<b>RESE-W04-X-O561-01</b>- 1/4 Watt 560 Ohm Resistor)

==Name==

An OOMP ID can also be used to construct the name of a component. To do this we use the 5 elements of the ID and a conversion chart. 
Name:<b>SIZE DESCRIPTION COLOR TYPE INDEX</b>

(ex. 
<b>RESE-W04-X-O561-01</b>- 1/4 Watt 560 Ohm Resistor 
<b>LEDS-10-G-FROS-01</b>- 10mm Frosted Green LED)

==Hex ID==

Each component is assigned a unique hexadecimal code. This is used to make linking to the component easy. 
(ex. 
<b>CRHO-I01-B-03PI-01</b>2.54mm 3 Pin Black Crimp Housing
Hex ID: DA03 Link: http://oom.lt/DA03/)
